          <h2>Rapid Response Teams</h2>
          <p>
            Rapid response teams are specialized groups trained to act quickly when disasters or emergencies occur.
            Their main goal is to reach affected areas fast, assess the situation, and deliver immediate help such
            as first aid, search and rescue, food, water, or temporary shelter before larger recovery efforts begin.
            These teams may include medical staff, logistics experts, engineers, or volunteers who work together under
            clear coordination systems so resources are used effectively.

          <h2>Relief Supplies</h2>
          <p>
            Relief supplies are essential goods delivered to people affected by disasters or crises so they can survive
            and recover until longer-term support arrives. They usually include safe drinking water, ready-to-eat food,
            blankets, warm clothing, tarpaulins or tents for temporary shelter, cooking utensils, hygiene kits, and
            basic medicines. In some situations, supplies may also include tools for rebuilding, baby formula, or items
            for protecting against extreme weather.

          <h2>Shelter & Safety</h2>
          <p>
            Shelter and safety are two of the most critical priorities in disaster relief and charitable work. When
            people lose their homes because of floods, earthquakes, fires, or conflict, they need a secure place to rest
            and recover. Temporary shelters — such as tents, community halls, or prefabricated cabins — give immediate
            protection from weather and danger, while longer-term projects aim to rebuild sturdy homes that can better
            withstand future hazards.

          <h2>Long-Term Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Long-term recovery is the phase of disaster response that begins after immediate relief and focuses on
            helping communities rebuild their lives in safe, sustainable ways. It goes beyond repairing damage — it
            works to restore housing, livelihoods, schools, healthcare, and social networks while addressing the root
            causes of vulnerability.
