    <h1>Healthcare Support</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Good health is the foundation of a happy life. 
      <b>Mother Care Charity</b> provides healthcare services, 
      medical check-ups, and awareness programs for underprivileged families.

        <h2>Medical Camps</h2>
        <p>
          Medical camps are temporary health clinics organized by charities, NGOs, or community groups 
          to bring essential healthcare services directly to people who might otherwise struggle to access them. 
          They’re often set up in rural areas, disaster zones, or low-income neighborhoods, providing free or 
          low-cost consultations, basic treatments, vaccinations, maternal and child care, and health education.

        <h2>Health Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          Health awareness refers to helping people understand how their everyday choices, environment, 
          and access to care affect their well-being — and encouraging habits that prevent illness. 
          Charities, schools, and health organizations often run campaigns, workshops, and screenings to teach 
          communities about topics such as nutrition, hygiene, vaccination, reproductive health, and managing chronic diseases.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Vaccination Drives</h2>
        <p>
          Vaccination drives are organized efforts — often led by charities, health departments, 
          or international agencies — to deliver vaccines to large groups of people, especially in areas 
          where routine health services may not reach everyone. They’re vital during outbreaks or when trying 
          to protect communities from preventable diseases such as measles, polio, influenza, or COVID-19.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Mental Health Support</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health support in charitable and humanitarian work focuses on helping people cope with stress, 
          grief, trauma, or other emotional challenges, especially after disasters or during difficult life circumstances. 
          It can include counseling, peer-support groups, helplines, art or play therapy, and training community members 
          to offer basic psychological first aid.
