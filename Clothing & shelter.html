          When people collect garments to donate to those in need are often shaped by social and 
          community-oriented theories rather than just logistics. One is Social Exchange Theory, 
          which suggests that people give because they value the sense of connection, reciprocity, 
          or goodwill they gain from helping others. Another is Altruism and Prosocial Behavior Theory, 
          which explains that many individuals act out of empathy and an internal desire to reduce someone's hardship.

        <h2>Shelter Support</h2>
        <p>
          Shelter support is one of the most important services charities provide after a disaster. 
          When homes are damaged or destroyed, people need a safe place to stay so they can recover and 
          protect themselves from weather, disease, and further harm. Humanitarian groups often set up 
          temporary solutions such as tents, community halls, or prefabricated structures, and later help 
          families rebuild permanent houses that are safer and more resilient than before.

        <h2>Winter Relief Programs</h2>
        <p>
          Winter relief programs are charitable initiatives designed to help people stay warm and safe 
          during cold weather, especially in regions where poverty, disasters, or displacement make 
          communities vulnerable. These programs usually focus on distributing warm clothing, blankets, quilts, 
          and heating supplies, as well as providing nutritious food so people can maintain their strength in harsh conditions.

        <h2>Long-term Shelter Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Long-term shelter projects are humanitarian or development initiatives that focus on rebuilding 
          safe, durable homes after disasters or in areas of chronic poverty. Unlike emergency tents or temporary huts, 
          these projects aim to create lasting housing that can withstand future hazards such as floods, earthquakes, or storms.
